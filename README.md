# Recipe Stash

Currently building a web app to search for recipes with whatever ingredients I have in my pantry using Spoonacular API, because I love cooking :)

This app allows users to search for recipes based on ingredients, dish name, or cuisine. You can use a recipe API, such as Spoonacular, to fetch the recipe data. Your app should display a list of recipes with images, titles, and short descriptions, and allow users to click on a recipe to view more details like ingredients and instructions.

This project will help you: - Learn how to implement search functionality in a React app. - Practice fetching and displaying data from an API.
