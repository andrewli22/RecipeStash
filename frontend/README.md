# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

Recipe Search App

A recipe search app allows users to search for recipes based on ingredients, dish name, or cuisine. You can use a recipe API, such as Spoonacular, to fetch the recipe data. Your app should display a list of recipes with images, titles, and short descriptions, and allow users to click on a recipe to view more details like ingredients and instructions.

This project will help you: - Learn how to implement search functionality in a React app. - Practice fetching and displaying data from an API.
